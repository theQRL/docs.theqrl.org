# Why? How? I ask...



## Wallet questions
* How will one tell how much fee is required to send qrl around the network?

* Explain the OTS index and what happens when it runs out?
	* Visual Representation?

* What encryption is used in the password generation using the web wallet?

	* Is this only used to load the wallet file later?

* Ability for wallet to connect to remote node running on external port


## Node Questions

* Is it possible to launch on separate ports? much like 
	* `monerod --rpc-port` and `--p2p-port` Allowing the ability to connect a node running on a separate pc from the pool/wallet


## Pool Questions

* Will running out of OTS keys in a pool wallet be an issue? Locked funds?
* can you estimate the ammount of time before pool runs out of OTS index?
