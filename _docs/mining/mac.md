Any modern PC with the latest OS updates should work running a full QRL node. 

## Minimum Hardware Requirements

* Most Linux / Unix based systems
* Any x86 or x64 based processor
* Support for AES-NI
* Enough space for the blockchain growth.


You should have a basic understanding of the CLI before attempting to set this up, it isn't really all that tough. If you have issues please drop into the Discord chat: [QRL discord Chat](discord.gg/RcR9WzX) Lots of friendly people over there ready to help.   
              
**Plan for the future!**

Make sure the computer you are using has enough power to handle the load of the mining operation. You will also need enough storage to keep the chain as it grows in the future. Recommend a few hundred gig HDD/SSD to sync the chain on long term to be safe.

## Install 

### brew

``` bash
# If you dont have brew already, install it with this command:  

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)
```

This will prompt you through a few questions while it installs.  

You can also follow the instructions found at the [brew main page](https://brew.sh/)

#### Update

Now that you have brew installed, update your package lists:  

``` bash
# Update brew package lists
brew update
```

#### Dependencies

``` bash
# Install the required dependencies:  
brew install cmake python3 swig boost hwloc
```

* * *

### Install QRL

We have some options for installing the QRL package. We can either use the package management system for python3 `pip3` **or** we can install from sources getting the files from GitHub.

#### pip3

```bash
# Install the QRL Package.

pip3 install -U qrl
```

If your having issues runnning the above command there are a few things to do that will help diagnose the issue. The `pip3` function comes with a logging capibility to see where the issues are happening.  

```bash
# Add Logging for pip3 

pip3 install -U qrl --log ~/pip3-Qrl.log
```

This will print details of the install to your home directory with the file name pip3-qrl.log.
The error should be inside.

### Create New Wallet

Before we create our new wallet there are a few things to know about.

*   The default location for the wallet and the chain is ~/.qrl unless you specify it on the command line. 
* Make sure this location has some room for the chain to grow.

### Create New Wallet

Create a new wallet with:  

#### Python Install

qrl wallet_gen

#### From Source

~/QRL/qrl/cli.py wallet_gen

This creates a wallet file in your ~/.qrl/ folder called wallet.qrl

* * *

### Get the Mnemonic and hexseed

To find your hexseed and recovery information for your wallet you will need to run:  
qrl wallet_secret  
Or  
~/QRL/qrl/cli.py wallet_secret

It will respond with a question Wallet idx [0]: Enter selects the default wallet shown, if you have more select the index that reflects the wallet.

*   This will show you the address and secret mnemonic for the wallet you created, stored in ~/.qrl/
*   Save it somewhere safe! Anyone with this information can recover your wallet and steal your coins.

* * *

### Recover Your Wallet

If you loose your wallet, the mining rig catches fire, or worse, you still have the ability to recover your Quanta as long as you've saved the hexseed or mnemonic phrase.  
qrl wallet_recover  
Or  
~/QRL/qrl/cli.py wallet_recover  
Without any other flags this will look for the hexseed you generated before.  
We can add the flag --seed-type [hexseed|mnemonic] to change the type of recovery method we want to use.

qrl --seed-type mnemonic
qrl --seed-type hexseed

~/QRL/qrl/cli.py --seed-type mnemonic
~/QRL/qrl/cli.py --seed-type hexseed

This will prompt up to enter the key or phrase. This should recover the wallet and ask if we want to save it. Enter y when prompted.

* * *

### Generate New slaves.json File

Using the wallet we just created lets create some files we can use to mine with.  
qrl -r --host 104.251.219.215 slave_tx_generate  
this will prompt you for some answers.

Src []: 0 the wallet you generated identified by #ID
Addr from (Leave blank in case same as source) []:
Number of slaves [0]: 4 How many wallet files do we want to slave?
Access type [0]: 1 Do we want to mine or transfer coins?
    0 <-- This gives all permissions from the master wallet to the slave wallet, this means the slave wallet can perform all transactions, on behalf of the master wallet, including sending coins.
    1 <-- This gives only mining permissions to the slave wallet. This means the slave wallet can sign blocks while mining, and credit the mining reward to the master address only, no other transactions out can occur. This setting allows incoming only transfers.
Fee [0.0]: 0

This will generate a slaves.json file for you and put into the directory you are in. We need to move it to the .qrl folder of whatever computer we plan to mine with.  
This will allow you to securely make a wallet file and generate a slaves.json file on a secure PC that wont let coin transfers happen. You can then move it to a public mining rig and not worry about people stealing your keys.  
Save the Mmneonic to a cold wallet file and when you need to move coins, restore the wallet, generate a new slaves.json with the correct privileges and transfer the coins out of the wallet.

#### From Local Directory

If you are running from git clone  
./qrl/cli.py -r --host 104.251.219.215 --wallet_dir /home/qrl/QRL/.qrl/ slave_tx_generate It will ask the same questions as above.

* * *

### Start the node

We need to move the slaves.json file we created above to our mining pc, and then start the node.

#### Run

qrl

if you installed with pip3

#### Or

~/QRL/start_qrl.py

if you are running from source

If you placed the slaves.json file into the correct directory the node should start up and begin mining. It may take a little while for the slave to become active. Be patient!.


* * *

### Node Commands

Some Handy Commands to query against your node.  

screen -d -m ~/QRL/start_qrl This will start QRL in a screen session.
    *   To attach the screen enter screen -r
    *   To exit the screen without quitting the program ctl + a then d this will detach the current screen session
tail -f ~/.qrl/qrl.log This will show the activity on your node if you run in --quiet | -q mode or in a screen session.
grep 'Solution Found' ~/.qrl/qrl.log Will print all of your found blocks. If this list is empty your node has not found anything yet.
grep 'Solution Found' ~/.qrl/qrl.log |wc -l Prints how many blocks you have found (count of won blocks)

* * *

### Install From Source

If you grabbed the source files from [https://github.com/theQRL](https://cnhv.co/1lce3)[GitHub](https://github.com/theQRL) the commands will differ a bit. Instead of the qrl command we will invoke

~/QRL/start_qrl.py Will start the node up and mine for us
*   You can see your options by running ./start_qrl.py --help This will give the following output.
    usage: start_qrl.py [-h] [--quiet] [--datadir DATA_DIR] [--no-colors] [-l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}] [--randomizeSlaveXMSS]
    optional arguments:
        -h, --help | show this help message and exit
        --quiet, -q | Avoid writing data to the console
        --datadir DATA_DIR, -d DATA_DIR | Retrieve data from a different path
        --no-colors | Disables color output
        -l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}, --loglevel {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL} Set the logging level
        --randomizeSlaveXMSS | Generates random slaves.json file (Warning: For Integration Test only)
~/QRL/qrl/cli.py gives us some of the other functions like generating a wallet and such.
    *   Running the command ./qrl/cli.py --help will give you the available options
    Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
    QRL Command Line Interface
    Options:
        -r, --remote connect to remote node

        --port_adm INTEGER remote port number (admin api) [9009]* will change
        --wallet_dir TEXT local wallet dir
        --help Show this message and exit.

### Config File

The default settings for the code are burried inside of the core directory. Instead of changing the settings there where an update would overwrite the changes create your own, add a file to your ~/.qrl folder titled config.yml

#### Download config.yml

You can grab a copy of this file directly from here with:  
wget https://qrl.co.in/public/config.yml  
Move it to your ~/.qrl folder  
mv config.yml ~/.qrl  
You can download a copy of this file here as well [config.yml](https://qrl.co.in/public/config.yml)  

#### Edit the config.yml

If you want to you can of course just create the file.  
nano ~/.qrl/config.yml  
Add the following to this file. All settings are default, however this file will override the default settings. Uncomment the lines you want to change. Beware that you can break things if you are not careful.
