Running a full node is easy and helps strengthen the QRL network. You should have a basic understanding of the CLI before attempting to set this up, it isn't really all that tough. Every answer you need is out there already, search online or drop into the QRL chat for help.

**Plan for the future!**

Make sure the computer you are using has enough power to handle the load of the mining operation. Low power computers do not run full nodes very well and are not recommended. You will also need enough storage to keep the chain as it grows in the future. A few hundred gig HDD/SSD to sync the chain on long term to be safe.

* * *

**Note**

*If you build on a small VPS or other light weight hardware you may run into issues building the package. Make sure you have enough *RAM* and enable *SWAP* if needed. Also ensure the HDD is large enough!*

* * *
### Minimum Hardware Requirements

* Most Linux / Unix based systems
* Any x86 or x64 based processor
* Support for AES-NI
* Enough space for the blockchain growth.

## Update and Dependencies 

```bash
# Issue the following command to update software
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Dependencies

```bash
# Install the required packages for QRL
sudo apt-get -y install swig3.0 python3-dev python3-pip build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libffi-dev libhwloc-dev libboost-dev
```
* * * 


### Install QRL

```bash
# Install the qrl Package.
pip3 install -U qrl
```
If you need to add logging and troubleshoot issues enter:

```
# Add Logging for pip3 
pip3 install -U qrl --log ~/pip3-Qrl.log
```
This will print details of the install to your home directory with the file name pip3-qrl.log. The error may be inside.

* * *

## Wallet

Create a new wallet using the `qrl` command. After you create a wallet you can create a new `slaves.json` file and use it to mine with.

### Create New Wallet

```bash
# Create a new wallet
qrl wallet_gen
```
### Get Mnemonic/hexseed

```bash
# Get mnemonic phrase and hexseed
qrl wallet_secret
```  

* * *

## Recover QRL Wallet

If you lose your wallet, the mining rig catches fire, or worse, you still have the ability to recover your Quanta as long as you've saved the hexseed or mnemonic phrase. 


```bash
# Options:
#   --seed-type [hexseed|mnemonic]
#   --help      Show this message and exit.

qrl wallet_recover --seed-type mnemonic
```

* * *

## Generate a slaves.json file

Using the wallet you just created generate the slaves.json file against a know working node. You can switch the ip-address with a trusted open node.

```
# QRL Nodes
104.237.3.185
104.237.3.184
104.251.219.145
104.251.219.40
```

```bash
# Generate slaves.json file
qrl -r --host 104.237.3.185 slave_tx_generate 
```
This will prompt with some questions:

```bash
Src []:                 # The wallet you generated by #ID
Addr from []:           # (Leave blank in case same as source)
Number of slaves [0]:   # Enter 4
Access type [0]:        # Mining only or transfer coins [0],[1]
                        # 0 Gives all permissions from the master wallet to slave wallet
                        # 1 Only mining permissions to slave wallet
                            # This setting allows incoming only transfers (SAFE)
Fee [0.0]: 0            # How much fee
```

This will generate a `slaves.json` in the directory you are in. If you need to generate another file later, you must use an **Unused** OTS. 

To specify an OTS index use the `--otsidx {INDEX#}` flag when you call ``slave_tx_generate` Change the INDEX# to an unused OTS key.

```bash
# Using index # 1 to generate slaves.json file
qrl -r --host 104.237.3.185 slave_tx_generate --otsidx 1
```

If you have saved the **Mnemonic** or **hexseed** somewhere safe you can delete the open `wallet.qrl` file and use the `slaves.json` file to mine with. 

Move this fie into your `~/.qrl` directory. If needed, create the directory.

* * * 

## Start QRL Node

Now that we have a `slaves.json` file in our ~/.qrl folder we can start qrl.

```bash
# start qrl
start_qrl
```

Check out all the options with a simple `start_qrl --help`

Using `screen` you can run in the background and reconnect later. You may need to install screen.

```bash
# run in background
screen -d -m start_qrl
```
You can see the progress in the `~/.qrl/qrl.log` file.

```bash
# watch the action with 
tail -f ~/.qrl/qrl.log
```

* * * 

## Config File

You can alter the default settings of the node by simply adding a file to your `~/.qrl` folder 

```bash
# Create and edit the config.yml file
nano ~/.qrl/config.yml
```

Add the following to the file. These are all default settings, uncomment to edit the parameters.

```bash

### Node Commands

Some Handy Commands to query against your node. 

``` bash
screen -d -m ~/QRL/start_qrl    # This will start QRL in a screen session.
screen -r                       # To reattach the screen
ctl+a d                         # Exit the screen without quitting the program
tail -f ~/.qrl/qrl.log          # Show activity in qrl.log

# Print found blocks. If empty your node has not found anything yet.
grep Solution Found ~/.qrl/qrl.log

# Prints how many blocks you have found (count of won blocks)
grep `Solution Found` ~/.qrl/qrl.log |wc -l   
```
