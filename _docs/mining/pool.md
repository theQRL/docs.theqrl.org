QRL uses the RandomX protocol and can be mined collectively using a centralized pool server and a collection of computers running mining software. 

This guide will walk through the steps required to get a pool up and running using [Our GithHub Fork](https://github.com/cyyber/cryptonote-nodejs-pool/) of the popular cryptonote-nodejs-pool software. This fork has been modified to run the QRL blockchain. You can use this as a basis for integrating QRL into your Pool or hosting your own private pool. 

It is assumed that the appropriate security measures have been taken to secure the server hosting this pool software. Please follow best practice and keep software up to date.

> Running a mining pool is not something that should be taken lightly. You need to have a good understanding of multiple complex administration and security practices.

## Requirements

#### Hardware

* minimum 4GB RAM 
* 2 Core CPU
* Support for AES-NI 
* Support for avx2 
* 64 bit Processor 
* high bandwidth network connection
* Dedicated IP address

#### Software and OS

* This guide uses Ubuntu 18.04LTS
* python 3.6
* All required dependencies specified in the [Pool software](https://github.com/cyyber/cryptonote-nodejs-pool/) repo

## QRL Install

Follow the instructions found [docs.theqrl.org/node/QRLnode/](https://docs.theqrl.org/node/QRLnode/) to get the node started.

### Start QRL and Sync

Create a configuration file to give the QRL node instructions on how to run. By default the QRL node will look in `{{ layout.v.qrlConf.qrlDir }}` You may need to create this directory if you have not started the node. 

> Note if you are running a testnet node, you will find the active qrl configuration at `{{ layout.v.qrlConf.testnetConfLocation }}`
{: .info}

Create a `{{ layout.v.qrlConf.confLocation }}` file and add these minimum configuration settings.

```yml
mining_enabled: False
enable_peer_discovery: True
mining_api_enabled: True
public_api_enabled: True
```

Make sure to restart the node to pickup the changes.

```bash
{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.startQRL }}
```

Check the state of the qrl node with 

```bash
{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.qrlState }}
```

Verify the local node blockheight matches the [block explorer](https://explorer.theqrl.org). This may take some time.

## grpcProxy

The QRL requires a bridge between the RPC and gRPC that QRL utilizes. The proxy handles the communication between the pool and the QRL node.

To use the proxy you must have a slaves.json file named `payment_slaves.json` in your `{{ layout.v.qrlConf.qrlDir }}` directory. To generate this file first you need a QRL wallet.

### QRL CLI Wallet

Generate a new QRL wallet using the QRL node CLI. With the node running enter:

```bash
# Creates a QRL wallet
qrl wallet_gen --height 12 --hash_function shake128 --encrypt
```

The cli will ask for an encryption password to encrypt the file. This password will be required every time this wallet is needed, typically to generate a new slave tree in the distant future. **DO not lose this password**


There now is a `wallet.json` file in the local directory the command was issued in. Backup this file to a secure location for future use if needed. This is the new pool wallet. Now generate slave trees to use for sending payments through the pools automated system. 

### QRL payment_slaves.json

With the encrypted QRL Wallet.json file can create a slave tree file. This file contains a new set of [One Time Signatures *(OTS)*](https://docs.theqrl.org/developers/ots/) generated from the main address that the pool will use to send transactions. See more on the XMSS slave trees in our [Documentation](https://docs.theqrl.org/wallet/slaves.json/)

To generate a slave file from the wallet, run the following command. This will create the slaves tree and broadcast a signed transaction with the slave tree public keys onto the QRL network, allowing the set of slaves to be used.

```bash
qrl slave_tx_generate --src 0 --master '' --number_of_slaves 100 --access_type 0 --fee .001
```

This will create a new file called slaves.json in the same directory you are in, sign the message and send onto the network. This transaction will require a small fee to broadcast to the network. Make sure you have enough funds to cover the fee. 

Move the `slaves.json` file to the `{{ layout.v.qrlConf.qrlDir }}` directory and rename to `payment_slaves.json`

### Start the QRL_gRPC_Proxy

Run the proxy with the following:

```bash
{{ layout.v.qrlCommands.grpcProxy }}
```

> Note: if you are running testnet, start the proxy with `--network-type testnet` to use the default testnet directory `{{ layout.v.qrlConf.qrlTestnetDir }} `. You will need to move the payments.slaves.json file to this directory as well.

#### Ports 

Check to see that you have open ports for the pool to communicate on using `netstat`

```bash 
netstat -tulnp
```

This will print all of the open ports on the server. Ensure ports `18090, 19007, 19009` are open and available for the pool.


## Pool Install

To install the pool follow the instructions in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cyyber/cryptonote-nodejs-pool/#cryptonote-nodejs-pool). This will guide you through the dependencies and various steps to getting the pool software installed. 

Please use the configuration found at the end of these docs to connect to the QRL node and wallet. this file lives at the root of the pool directory as `config.json`


## Install Web Server

You will need a web server setup somewhere pointed at the pool API port. See the README.md in the pool Github for instructions on setting up the web front end. There is an additional configuration file needed to host the web server. 

Most importantly, ensure the port is available to the web server and you can reach the address or IP externally. 

* `var api = "http://pool.FQDN_OR_IP:8117";`


## Start The Pool

With the QRL node fully synced and running, slaves.json file in the correct place, {{ layout.v.qrlConf.confLocation }} file correctly filled out, and the qrl_grpc_proxy running, you can start the pool.

from the root pool directory, run

```bash
node init.js
```

Enjoy.

## Pool Config File

Copy the `/config_examples/qrl.json` file found in the repository to `/config.json` and overview each option. Change any to match your preferred setup however pay attention to the following few configurations, as they are important. 

* "poolAddress": "Q01060019b0f4ce8ea82e71a5fc60851541db7e515d2585247c70533487cc89c50f6dddb8a4f386",
* "daemon": { "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 18090 },
