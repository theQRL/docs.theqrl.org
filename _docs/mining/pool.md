title: Setup a QRL Pool
categories: mining
tags: mining
---

To fully utilize the benefits of multiple devices or GPU mining rigs one can setup a stratum pool and use multiple machines to mine as the same device, effectively raising the hashrate of the mining efforts and increasing the odds of finding blocks. 

Running a pool will also increase the redundancy and decentralization of the blockchain. A mining pool is required to run a full QRL node, syncing and verifying transactions on the network by default.

Anyone can run a pool with some basic Linux knowledge and a will to google for the answers. You can have a pool setup in a matter of a few hours. If you need help, reach out to the community in the discord chat or Reddit.

## Requirements

Here are the basic requirements for the pool. Depending on the amount of miners connected you may need to upgrade the servers to handle the load. 

#### Hardware Requirements
You will need a server to host the Pool, QRL Node and Wallet files. you will also need to serve up some web files for miners to interact with the pool.The Web Front end server can be the same server *This guide will use a separate server for web serving.*

**Node Server**
* 4GB RAM 
* 2 Core 
* Support for AES-NI
* HDD large enough to support the blockchain over time ( > 120GB )

This guide is using {Linode's 4GB}(https://www.linode.com/pricing) server to run the pool and node on. There's also a 120GB drive mounted as the user `qrl` /home/qrl/ dir.
For a guide on how to do this see [here](https://linode.com/docs/platform/how-to-use-block-storage-with-your-linode/)

Feel free to use any hosting provider as long as the server meets the above requirements you should be OK.

#### Software and OS

* This guide uses Ubuntu 16.04, it's recommended
* python3.5 or greater is required
* node 0.10.48

## Overview

The basics of setting up a pool.

- 0.) Setup, connect, update, and upgrade your server.
- 1.) Install qrl on the server.
- 2.) Install Pool
	- a.) Dependencies, including node v0.10.48 using nvm
	- b.) Install Redis-server and configure
	- c.) Install Apache2 and configure web server

## QRL Install
Follow the instructions found at [docs.theqrl.org/mining/full-node/](https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/full-node/) to get the node started.

#### From Sources
If you want to get the latest changes and run from cli get the latest files here. *!Advanced!*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theqrl/qrl --branch v0.62
cd ~/qrl
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # didn’t work, permission issues...
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -e . # didn’t work, permission issues...
sudo -H pip3 install -e .
# Now I can see all options when I run
~/qrl/start_qrl --help
# and 
~/qrl/qrl/cli.py --help
```


## Pool Install

Pool Configuration Instructions for QRL. most of this comes from the source repo found at [Node-JS-Pool Link FIXME](#). Some changes have been made to the source to allow for QRL mining. 

#### Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libboost-all-dev git screen 
```


#### NodeJS

Following [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04) guide to install nodeJS via `nvm`

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
```

#### nvm

```bash
# Grab nvm
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh -o install_nvm.sh
# Install nvm
bash install_nvm.sh
```

This will install the software into a subdirectory of your home directory at ~/.nvm. It will also add the necessary lines to your ~/.profile file to use the file.

To use log out or run
```bash
source ~/.profile
```

#### Install Node

```bash
nvm install 0.10.48

nvm use 0.10.48
nvm alias default 0.10.48
nvm use default
```

#### Redis

Install redis-server to handle keeping track of everything.

```bash
wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
cd redis-stable
make
make install
```

#### Install Redis properly

Create a directory where to store your Redis config files and your data:

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/redis
sudo mkdir /var/redis
```

Copy the init script

```bash
sudo cp utils/redis_init_script /etc/init.d/redis_6379
```

Edit the script

```bash
sudo nano /etc/init.d/redis_6379
```

> Make sure to modify *REDISPORT* accordingly to the port you are using. Both the pid file path and the configuration file name depend on the port number.
{: .info}


## Pool Config

Clone the repo found at [Github](https://github.com/cyyber/node-cryptonote-pool.git)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyyber/node-cryptonote-pool.git QRL_Pool

cd qrlPool
npm update
```

This will take awhile to run. Grab a coffee.


### Config files

Copy the config_example.json file to config.json then overview each options and change any to match your preferred setup. 

> *Do not copy the file shown below, use the one in your local directory*
{: .info}


Here is the config file with comments:

}
```

#### Interesting config.json Sections

**Pool Wallet**
```json
        "poolAddress": "Q01060036ea9340ab68df7f8a3c4c4e9a1d3fd30c3dcd0492f1ae2eb07fc2b15ef4c72216d9c5a5",
```        

Edit the *poolAddress* field. Change to the address you want to mine with. This is where you will pool the rewards and pay out the the other miners.

**Ports**
```json
        "ports": [
            {
                "port": 3333,
                "difficulty": 100,
                "desc": "Low end hardware"
            },
            {
                "port": 5555,
                "difficulty": 2000,
                "desc": "Mid range hardware"
            },
            {
                "port": 7777,
                "difficulty": 10000,
                "desc": "High end hardware"
            },
            {
                "port": 8888,
                "difficulty": 10000,
                "desc": "Hidden port",
                "hidden": true
            }

```

Change the ports above if you are running another pool on the same server, or if you need to adjust your configuration. Make sure to enable the firewall for these ports as well.


**Payments**
```json
 "payments": {
        "enabled": true,
        "interval": 600,
        "maxAddresses": 50,
        "mixin": 3,
        "transferFee": 500000000,
        "minPayment": 100000000000,
        "denomination": 100000000000
    },

```

This section will allow you to adjust the amount where the pool pays out. Change this to allow lower threshold payments or larger depending on your needs. More often TX may equal more TX fees. 

**api**
```json
"api": {
        "enabled": true,
        "hashrateWindow": 600,
        "updateInterval": 5,
        "port": 8117,
        "blocks": 30,
        "payments": 30,
        "password": "your_password"
```

You can adjust what port the pool api runs on, as well as setting a password. Please set a password.


All of the connection details are found at the bottom of the config file. 
port 18081 is where the qrl proxy will be running.


```json
    "daemon": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 18081
    },

    "wallet": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 18081
    },

    "redis": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 6379,
        "auth": null
    }
```



## grpcProxy

You need to run a grpcProxy via python in order to connect the pool to the node. they run on separate ports and use different you will find this piece of code


in order to run the proxy you will need to generate a slaves.json file. Use the cli tools and generate a file with 

```bash
./cli.py -r --host {ActiveNode Open To Port:9009} --port_pub 9000 --port_adm 9000 --wallet_dir . slave_tx_generate
```
This will ask you a few questions. Make sure you run this in a directory with a valid wallet file. You may need to restore the wallet first.


Once the slaves.json file is created, move it to the ~/.qrl folder and rename to payments.slaves.json file

```bash
sudo mkdir /home/.qrl
sudo mv slaves.json /home/.qrl/payment_slaves.json
```

This will allow the pool the ability to send the payments out to miners and won't use all of the available OTS keys for the wallet. I generated a slaves file with 100 slaves, which took awhile. this will give me a factor of 1024\*100 signatures before I need to generate another slaves.json file and set it in the ~/.qrl directory.

Make the proxy executable with 

```bash
sudo chmod +x ~/qrl/qrl/grpcProxy.py
```

run the proxy with the following:

```bash
screen -R proxy
python3.5 ~/qrl/qrl/grpcProxy.py
```

You may want to daemonize this, or run this in a screen session. This will connect the grpc QRL functions with the rpc functions the pool is looking for. the proxy will look for connections at 127.0.0.1:18081



## Install Web Server

You can serve the web site up on any typical web server. This guide is using the apache2 web server to serve up the site.

You should have a Domain name to point to the server and have setup the relitive DNS entries. This is outside of the scop of this document. Obce you have your DNS pointing at the correct place change the hostname of the server

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```

Enter your hostname without the fqdn part
```bash
pool
```

Now edit the /etc/hosts file
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
``` 

here you will find a few lines, change the file from this:

```bash
127.0.0.1 localhost

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

```

 to this with your details entered. 

```bash  
 IP.ADD.RE.SS hostname.fqdn hostname
``` 

```bash
127.0.0.1       localhost
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx   pool.theqrl.org  pool

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters


```

Use the public IP address of your server in the hosts file.

Find your IP by
```bash
curl -4 icanhazip.com
```
This will spit put your public IP

#### apache2

```bash
sudo apt install apache2
```

This will install apache2 and creates a few interesting directories

You will find config files in */etc/apache2/*

```console
qrl@qrlpool:~/qrl$ ls -al /etc/apache2/
total 88
drwxr-xr-x  8 root root  4096 Mar 25 05:54 .
drwxr-xr-x 94 root root  4096 Mar 25 05:54 ..

drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Mar 25 05:54 sites-enabled
```

The Web Root is in /var/www/html/

```console
qrl@qrlpool:~/qrl$ ls -al /var/www/html/
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Mar 25 05:54 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 Mar 25 05:54 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 11321 Mar 25 05:54 index.html
```


#### Configure apache2

edit the default apache2 config

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

Add the ServerName directive into the file somewhere
```
ServerName {YOUR-FQDN or IP address}
```

Exit and edit the default sites config

```
nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```


Add ServerAlias and change the ServerName *not nessasary but helps connect sometimes*
```bash
ServerName {FQDN or IP}
ServerAlias *.{FQDN}
```


restart apache2 to pickup changes
```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

If you see errors check the log files and Googl for help.







#### Create Website

Copy the files found in the pool directory into the web root. This is assuming you are not hosting any other sites on the server you are using for the web front end.

```bash
# remove the web root contents
sudo rm -r /var/www/html/*

# Copy the web file into the Web Root
sudo cp -r ~/QRL_pool/* /var/www/html/ 
```

Change permissions to weberver user

```bash
sudo chown www-data:www-data -R /var/www/html/
```

Now edit the config.js file found in the web root

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/html/config.js
```

Change the details to meet your needs


## Secure The Server

#### SSH Connections

Edit the ssh config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd.conf
```

change the following parameters



#### Firewall

Using ufw enable openssh, Apache2, pool ports, API port, and disable any access to redis ports. 

> **Note** You need to make sure and enable OpenSSH or the port you have configured for SSH connections.
{: .info}

```bash
# first, dont lock your self out
sudo ufw enable openssh

# now block external redis connections
sudo ufw deny 6379
sudo ufw deny 16379
sudo ufw deny 26379

# enable mining ports in the firewall
sudo ufw allow 3333
sudo ufw allow 5555
sudo ufw allow 7777

# Open the API port for web front end if hosting remotely
sudo ufw allow 8117

# enable apache2 port 80 and 443
sudo ufw allow "Apache Full"

# Enable UFW
sudo ufw enable 

# Check UFW
sudo ufw status
```


#### LetsEncrypt setup

Follow the guide found at [certbot.eff.org](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-apache)

Setup and configure the server to run https by default

```bash
# install ppa and package certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache

# run certbot auto apache2 setup
sudo certbot --apache
```
Enter default settings and agree to all of the terms and conditions.

Now you have a secure web server for connections. 

## Start The Pool

With the node running, slaves.json file in place and the proxy running, we can start the node.

```bash
# start another screen session
screen -R Pool

# Start the pool in screen
cd ~/QRL_pool
node init.js
```

You should see the pool connect, and when miners connect you will see addresses and details streaming across this screen.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure you create a slaves.json file large enough to continue to payout. Once you run out you will have to create another slave.json file and move/rename it into the `/home/.qrl/` dir.

## To-Do

* Configure to run forever - CRON jobs and daemons
* Harden server
* .....
