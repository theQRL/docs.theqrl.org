title: Running A QRL Full Node
categories: mining
tags: mining
---

Running a full node is easy and helps strengthen the QRL network. You can run QRL on most operating systems, though Ubuntu 16.04 is recommended.

You should have a basic understanding of the CLI before attempting to set this up, it isn't really all that tough. Every answer you need is out there already, search online or drop into the QRL chat for help.

#### Plan For The Future

Make sure the computer you are using has enough power to handle the load of the mining operation. Low power computers do not run full nodes very well and are not recommended. 

You will also need enough storage to keep the chain as it grows in the future. A few hundred gig HDD/SSD to sync the chain on long term to be safe.

**Note**

*If you build on a small VPS or other light weight hardware you may run into issues building the package. Make sure you have enough *RAM* and enable *SWAP* if needed. AES-NI is required for cryptographic functions.*


## Minimum Requirements

* \*Most Linux / Unix based systems
* Any x86 or x64 based processor
* Support for AES-NI
* Enough HDD space for the blockchain growth.

## Install on Linux


#### Ubuntu 16.04

##### Update 

Update your system ensuring you have the latest packages.

```bash
# Issue the following command to update software
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### Dependencies

```bash
# Install the required packages for QRL
sudo apt-get -y install swig3.0 python3-dev python3-pip build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libffi-dev libhwloc-dev libboost-dev
```

#### Redhat/fedora

Fedora 27 install instructions 

```bash
Update
dnf update 
```

```bash
# Install required packages
dnf install swig cmake gcc gcc-c++ redhat-rpm-config python3-devel python-devel hwloc-devel boost-devel
```

-----------------------------------------------------------
Add these to the guide as they come. If there is different or special instructions for installing on various distros.

#### Debian


#### BSD


#### OpenSUSE


#### ArchLinux


#### Any Other Linux

## Install on MacOS

To build in OSX Please install `brew` if you have not already.

```bash
# Install brew with
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" 
```

This will prompt you through a few questions while it installs.

Having Issues? Please follow the instructions found at the brew main page: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
# Update brew
brew update
brew install cmake python3 swig boost hwloc
```

#### Install QRL

The procedure to installing the qrl full node for a Mac is the exact same as it is in Linux. Once you have the Brew Packages installed proceed through the guide 


## Install on Windows 10

\*Windows support in the current version is limited. An alternative is to use an Ubuntu VM (virtualbox), or install Ubuntu using the Linux Subsystem for Windows.

#### Ubuntu on Linux Subsystem for Windows (WSL)

You can run a full node in Windows utilizing the Windows Subsystytem for Linux. There are a ton of guides out there on setting this up. Here are a few links to get you going.

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a new Windows 10 feature that enables you to run native Linux command-line tools directly on Windows, alongside your traditional Windows desktop and modern store apps.

You can follow [these instructions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10) to install Ubuntu using Linux Subsystem,

#### Install QRL

The procedure to installing the qrl full node in WSL is the exact same as it is in Linux or MacOS. Once you have the WSL system setup and running Ubuntu proceed through the guide 

*A native Windows solution is in the works*

## Install QRL 

Now that we have a freshly updated system, the installation of QRL is a breeze, QRL uses python3 to install. Using the Python3 package installer *pip3* we will install qrl.

```bash
# Install the qrl Package.
pip3 install -U qrl
```
This will install the qrl package and any required dependencies. Once this is done you can create a new wallet.

## Creating a Wallet

Create a new wallet using the `qrl` command. For a full list of options run: 

```bash
qrl --help
```

#### Create New Wallet

```bash
# Create a new wallet
qrl wallet_gen
```
#### Get Mnemonic/hexseed

```bash
# Get mnemonic phrase and hexseed
qrl wallet_secret
```  



## Recover QRL Wallet

If you lose your wallet, the mining rig catches fire, or worse, you still have the ability to recover your Quanta as long as you've saved the hexseed or mnemonic phrase. 

```bash
# Options:
#   --seed-type [hexseed|mnemonic]
#   --help      Show this message and exit.

qrl wallet_recover --seed-type mnemonic
```

 
 

## Start QRL Node

Now that we have a QRL wallet address, we can `start_qrl`. This will begin the qrl node and start mining. If you have passed any command line options they will override the default settings. *you can set the mining threads etc.*

```bash
# start qrl
start_qrl
```

Check out all the options with a simple `start_qrl --help`

Using `screen` you can run in the background and reconnect later. You may need to install screen.

```bash
# run in background
screen -d -m start_qrl
```
You can see the progress in the `~/.qrl/qrl.log` file.

```bash
# watch the action with 
tail -f ~/.qrl/qrl.log
```

 

## Config File

You can alter the default settings of the node by simply adding a file to your `~/.qrl` folder 

```bash
# Create and edit the config.yml file
nano ~/.qrl/config.yml
```

Add the following to the file. These are all default settings, uncomment to edit the parameters.

```bash

### Node Commands

Some Handy Commands to query against your node. 

``` bash
screen -d -m ~/QRL/start_qrl    # This will start QRL in a screen session.
screen -r                       # To reattach the screen
ctl+a d                         # Exit the screen without quitting the program
tail -f ~/.qrl/qrl.log          # Show activity in qrl.log

# Print found blocks. If empty your node has not found anything yet.
grep Solution Found ~/.qrl/qrl.log

# Prints how many blocks you have found (count of won blocks)
grep `Solution Found` ~/.qrl/qrl.log |wc -l   
```
