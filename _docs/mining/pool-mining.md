Pool mining is the process of multiple users pooling their resources in order to create a larger processing power. The miners then split the rewards they collect as the pool evenly depending on the amount of input.

In order to mine QRL using a PC without syncing the entire blockchain you can connect to a QRL Pool run by our community members. This will allow you to utilize almost any piece of hardware without the need to run a full node. 

There are lightweight binaries and scripts that use the local processor or GPU to perform work for the pool. This pooled work then gets submitted to the network and the rewards are shared between the workers.

> QRL Uses the Monero v7 cryptonight algorithm to validate work on the QRL network. This allows QRL the same ASIC resistant benefits as Monero along with the added Quantum Resistant features.

## Pool 101


A few things to know about pools:

* There is no **Official** QRL pool. The team will only run a *TestNet* pool if necessary for testing.
* Most pools charge fee to use the service. This should go towards things like server costs and power consumption for the pool systems.
* Pools can change the payout minimum amounts. Be sure to read the fine print and make sure you understand the rules.
* Do not leave any amount of QRL on the pool. If there is an option to transfer to your wallet, do so at the minimum amount.

To connect to a pool you will need a QRL address that will collect the rewards of the pool mining. You will enter this as the user for the pool. You can also search the stats of your miner by entering this into the bottom of most mining pool sites.

## Requirements

- Computer to use for mining
- Mining Software used to interact with the pool
- QRL wallet address to send the rewards

Pool mining is possible using both CPU's and GPU's. The benefit of one over the other is debatable and outside this guides scope.

Download a mining software package for your operating system and follow the software's documentation, only changing out the address with your QRL address.

## Mining Software

There are quite a few mining software packages out there available for windows, Mac and Linux. We will not cover all of the options here.
