*Note: Those with unclaimed ERC20s from the pre-sale in April/May 2017 will be contacted separately in order to assist them receiving Mainnet Quanta (We ❤ Our Hodlers)*

## 1. Make Your QRL Wallet and QRL Address

The ways that one can make a QRL address are

- (easiest) Use a QRL wallet service to generate a wallet using your browser (such as our web wallet at https://wallet.theqrl.org)
- Run your own node
- Download and run our QRL wallet software from GitHub [LINK HERE]

## 2. Go to The QRL Token Migration Page

Once you have a QRL Address of your own, you can open the Token Migration App

1. Paste in your QRL Address.
2. Enter an email address into the next field. All QRL ERC20 Burn Addresses are monitored and emails will be sent periodically when new transactions are detected to confirm QRL Mainnet Wallet balance.
3. Hit “Submit” and an Ethereum address will be generated and displayed to you: This is your Burn Address. Each QRL ERC20 token sent to this address will be credited in a 1:1 ratio with QRL coins (Quanta) credited to the QRL Wallet address you entered on Mainnet launch.
4. If you should lose, forget, or for whatever reason need to re-generate your QRL ERC20 Burn Address, you can simply by re-entering your QRL Wallet address into the token migration app.
Every time you send your QRL ERC20 tokens from anywhere (exchange, myetherwallet, etc) to the burn address, your QRL wallet balance will be updated. If you entered an email address, you will receive a confirmation message.

## 3. Other/FAQ

Once you have your QRL ERC20 Burn Address, you can now send QRL ERC20 tokens to that address, and they will be credited as Main Network QRL coins (Quanta) at launch.

If launch has already occured, then they will be deposited into the QRL Wallet address you provided via a normal transaction on the QRL Network.

If you have any questions, we are available for support on Discord (Channel #Migration_Support), or send an email to [info@theqrl.org](mailto:info@theqrl.org)

Reminder: Those with unclaimed ERC20s from the pre-sale will be contacted separately in order to assist them receiving Mainnet Quanta.
