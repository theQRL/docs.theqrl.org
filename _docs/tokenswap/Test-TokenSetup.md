#### Test Requirements

Before you get started, there are a few things you should know about:

* You will need some TEST-Ethereum to use as gas. 
	* Enter your ROPSTEN address into a ROPSTEN faucet to get ETH to use for GAS
		* <a href="https://faucet.bitfwd.xyz" target="_blank">bitfwd faucet</a>
		* * <a href="http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/" target="_blank">ropsten faucet</a> 

* This is only a test. **DO NOT SEND REAL QRL HERE!**
* If you have any issues Please use the QRL Discord channel to discuss. The developers are available to answer any questions.


## Test-Token Swap Instructions

Here are the three easy steps to participate in the test-token migration:

### Step 1

#### Generate TEST Ethereum Burn Address.

Use "My Ether Wallet" to setup a test ether address. Once this address is setup the team will send you test-QRL to play with in the Test-Token swap process. Grab some test-Ethereum to use for gas to process the transactions.

Go to <a href="https://myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" >https://myetherwallet.com </a> and create a new wallet using the **ROPSTEN** test network.

Make sure you select the correct network in the top right.



 On the next screen you will have the oppertunity to save a wallet
You will be asked to save a `.json` file. You can skip if you want, and simply save the private key that is printed on the following screen.

With the new private key, unlock the test wallet. Select the private key option and enter your key in the box.

With the wallet unlocked, you can see your new TestNet address.

#### PASTE YOUR ADDRESS INTO DISCORD:

```bash
My ROPSTEN ADDRESS: {0x3cad8671b32bD14aCE060E12859Ce91D190dBa0B}
```

Please use your own address, not the one I generated...

#### Test QRL

Tag @developer in the chat once you have posted the address and they will send you some test quanta to your new address

When the team is ready to start the test they will send you TEST-QRL to this address. This will pretend to be your hard earned Test-QRL ERC-20 tokens that you have stashed for real. 

The amount won't really matter and the team will divvy up the tokens as they see fit.



## Checking Token balance

 Using an unlocked MyEtherWallet add the QRL token contract details into the "Add Custom Token" Field.

#### Details to enter in the test ETH wallet 
 * **ERC20 contract:**  0xcee7820f25bd1852b65d6d7fd8b28f3fe6794dbc
 * **Token Name:** QRL
 * **Token Decimals:** 8

After you enter the details and click the "save" button, you will see the amount of Test QRL ERC20 you have in your wallet from the QRL team.
