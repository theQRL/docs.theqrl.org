This guide will outline, in a step-by-step guide, how to migrate your QRL ERC20 tokens, using our web app, and end up with Main Network QRL coins (Quanta).

> Note: Those with unclaimed ERC20s from the pre-sale in April/May 2017 will be contacted separately in order to assist them receiving Mainnet Quanta (We ❤ Our Hodlers)

## Step 1 — Make Your QRL Wallet

The ways that one can make a QRL address are

* Web Wallet
	* *(easiest)* Use a QRL wallet service to generate a wallet using your browser (such as the <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org" target="_blank">QRL Web Wallet</a>)
* Run your own node
	* Grab the [Full Node]() files and setup a full QRL node to create a wallet. Follow our [Full Node Setup Guide](/mining/full-node)
* Run the QRL Wallet App
	* Download and run our QRL wallet software from [GitHub](#)


Once you have a valid QRL wallet generated via one of the above steps continue with the guide. You need to generate a new QRL address on the **Main QRL Network**, not the *test-Network*


## Step 2 — QRL Token Migration Page

Once you have a QRL Address of your own, you can open the [Token Migration App](#) This will be the interface between the ERC20Tokens and the real QRL coins.

Paste in your QRL Address you generated in step 1. This will be the new address your QRL coins will be sent to after swap

Enter an email address into the next field if you want to receive updates when tokens are swapped. All QRL ERC20 Burn Addresses are monitored and emails will be sent periodically when new transactions are detected to confirm QRL MainNet Wallet balance.

Hit “Submit” and an Ethereum address will be generated and displayed to you:

This is your Burn Address. Each QRL ERC20 token sent to this address will be credited in a 1:1 ratio with QRL coins (Quanta) credited to the QRL Wallet address you entered on MainNet launch.

> If you should lose, forget, or for whatever reason need to re-generate your QRL ERC20 Burn Address, you can simply by re-entering your QRL Wallet address into the token migration app.

## Step 3 — Swapping Tokens

Now that we have a burn address created we can begin the swap.

Every time you send your QRL ERC20 tokens from anywhere (exchange, myetherwallet, etc) to the burn address, your QRL wallet balance will be updated. If you entered an email address, you will receive a confirmation message.

#### Burn Instructions

Open the ETH wallet that contains your QRL ERC20 tokens and send them to the new burn address you created. It's recommended to send a small amount of QRL tokens first to make sure you have followed the steps throughly.


## Other/FAQ

Once you have your QRL ERC20 Burn Address, you can send QRL ERC20 tokens to that address, and they will be credited as Main Network QRL coins (Quanta) at launch.

If launch has already occured, then they will be deposited into the QRL Wallet address you provided via a normal transaction on the QRL Network.
