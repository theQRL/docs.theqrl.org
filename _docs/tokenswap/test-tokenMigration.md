The QRL Team put out a call to participate in a test token swap happening on the ROPSTEN Ethereum network.

These instructions are meant for the participants of the #Test-Migration group from the <a href="https://discord.gg/E9PWvbG" target="_blank">Discord Chat</a>. 

If you were not specifically told to follow these instructions, **DON'T!**

**THIS TEST IS JUST A TEST. NO REAL QUANTA WILL BE BURNED OR TRANSFERRED DURING THIS TEST. THIS IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.**




## Test-Token Swap Instructions

Here are the three easy steps to participate in the test-token migration:

## Step 1

Generate \*TEST\* Ethereum Burn Address.

Use "My Ether Wallet" to setup a test ether address. Once this address is setup the team will send you test-QRL to play with in the Test-Token swap process. Grab some test-Ethereum to use for gas to process the transactions.

Go to <a href="https://myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" >https://myetherwallet.com </a> and create a new wallet using the **ROPSTEN** test network.

Make sure you select the correct network in the top right.

You will be asked to save a `.json` file. You can skip if you want, and simply save the private key that is printed on the following screen.

With the new private key, unlock the test wallet. Select the private key option and enter your key in the box.

With the wallet unlocked, you can see your new TestNet address.

#### PASTE YOUR ADDRESS INTO DISCORD:

```bash
My ROPSTEN ADDRESS: {0x3cad8671b32bD14aCE060E12859Ce91D190dBa0B}
```

Please use your own address, not the one I generated...

#### Test QRL

When the team is ready to start the test they will send you TEST-QRL to this address. This will pretend to be your hard earned Test-QRL ERC-20 tokens that you have stashed for real. 

The amount won't really matter and the team will divvy up the tokens as they see fit.


## Step 2 

Make your QRL Wallet and QRL Address (from the web wallet, or your QRL node via CLI).

Browse to <a href="https://wallet.theqrl.org" target="_blank">https://wallet.theqrl.org</a> and create a new QRL wallet. You will be required to enter a password.

Record all of the details for your new QRL wallet somewhere you won't lose them.



## Step 3

Go to The QRL Token Migration Page and put in your fresh, backed-up QRL address into the QRL address field.

You can enter an email address here as well *(optional).*

This will generate a personal burn address for you to use. Anytime you send Test-QRL ERC20 to the reusable Ethereum Burn Address, Test-QRL Coins will be deposited 1:1 into the QRL Wallet created in Step 2.

## Test Requirements

There are a few things you should know about:

* You will need some test Ethereum to use as gas. Enter your address into the <a href="https://faucet.bitfwd.xyz" target="_blank">ROPSTEN faucet</a> to get ETH
* This is only a test. **DO NOT SEND REAL QRL HERE!**
* If you have any issues Please use the QRL Discord chat to communicate 


## Checking Test-Token balance

 Using an unlocked MyEtherWallet add the QRL token contract details into the "Add Custom Token" Field.

#### Details to enter in the test ETH wallet 
 * **ERC20 contract:**  0xcee7820f25bd1852b65d6d7fd8b28f3fe6794dbc
 * **Token Name:** QRL
 * **Token Decimals:** 8

After you enter the details and click the "save" button, you will see the amount of Test QRL ERC20 you have in your wallet from the QRL team.
